# Customs
This script takes data from custom League of Legends games and outputs them onto a Google Sheet.

## How to Use
1. Setup [pygsheets](https://pygsheets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authorization.html).

2. Create Google Sheets with titles that match the sheets being opened in the script.
Here are [some templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DYUr2hkn-mtoWqRQ6WcIjmuk_pj9BeGc?usp=sharing) (copy them to your Drive) to start with that match the sheet names in the script.

3. Run 'python customs.py' in the project directory.
